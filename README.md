### ðŸŒ± AI-Powered Plant Disease Detection ðŸŒ¿
This project applies machine learning to identify plant diseases with high accuracy. By leveraging algorithms like Support Vector Machine (SVM), K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Decision Tree, Random Forest, and NaÃ¯ve Bayes, we analyze plant images to detect signs of infection.

##  How It Works
 - Feature Extraction: Techniques like Histogram of Oriented Gradients (HOG) and wavelets help identify crucial visual patterns in plant images.
 - Model Training: Extracted features are fed into multiple classifiers to evaluate their performance in disease detection.
 - Key Insight: Among the tested models, SVM combined with color-based features delivers the most accurate results.
##  Why It Matters
Early detection of plant diseases enables farmers to take preventive action, improving crop yield and overall plant health. This project aims to contribute to smarter, data-driven agriculture for a more sustainable future.
